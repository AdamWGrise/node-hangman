# Node Hangman!

Lots of information in the comments of the JS files. This uses constructors and lots of objects/methods/arrays for a console-based hangman game. Console graphics also included - try it out! If you have Node installed, you can just run this through a terminal like PowerShell, VS Code's terminal, Bash, etc. Navigate to the files in your terminal and go "node index.js", and you're good to go.

Features a similar word theme to my first JS Word Guess Game project - woodworking shop tools and equipment. Although, the commentary in this version isn't quite as snarky. I mean, it's bad enough we're hanging a dude, isn't it? :(

Uses the Inquirer NPM package for user inputs.

Constraints on user input: The game prevents inputs of more than one character at a time. Also prevents numbers/symbols/spaces, as well as duplicate guesses; these "bad" guesses, luckily, won't count against the player.
